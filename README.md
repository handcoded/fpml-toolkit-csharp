# The HandCoded C# Toolkit for FpML Processing 

This is the official GIT repository for the HandCoded FpML Toolkit for FpML
processing. We have moved it here from SourceForge as part of our work producing
an ASP.Net website and client application to demonstrate FpML use in conjunction
with Web Services.

The C# source files on SourceForge will no longer be updates. All updates, bug
fixes and additions will be released here.
